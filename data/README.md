# Data Directory

This directory is for storing OSM and GTFS data files.

## OSM Data
Place OpenStreetMap data files (`.osm`, `.pbf`) in this directory.

## GTFS Data
Place General Transit Feed Specification data files (`.gtfs`, `.zip`) in this directory.

These large data files are excluded from Git to keep the repository lightweight. 
Download the required data files separately and place them here.
